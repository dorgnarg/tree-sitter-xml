XML Grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) forked
from [dorgnarg/tree-sitter-xml](https://github.com/dorgnarg/tree-sitter-xml).

This fork brings **highlight**ing for the existing grammar. It also fixes errors
in the grammar (typos in rules, confusion with `\s` and `\s+`).

Example files come from W3C samples, [generated data](www.generatedata.com),
and [wikimedia dumps](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/).
